    <!-- Chosen Palette: Serene Ocean (Stone, Slate, Cyan, with Orange accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application centered around an interactive map of Planet 4546B. A persistent vertical timeline allows for both chronological and non-linear exploration of the story. Clicking on map markers or timeline events dynamically updates a main content panel with narrative text, character logs, and data visualizations (e.g., creature threat levels). This structure was chosen to transform the linear text-based report into an immersive, explorable world, mirroring the game's core loop of exploration and discovery, enhancing user engagement and understanding of the spatial relationships between key events. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core narrative is broken into event-based snippets tied to map locations (Goal: Inform). This is presented in a "PDA" style panel. Creature encounters are visualized using a Chart.js horizontal bar chart to quantify threat levels (Goal: Compare). The multi-chapter rocket construction is tracked via a dynamic progress bar (Goal: Show Change). This approach uses interactive elements and simple data viz to make the story's key challenges (danger, resource gathering, construction) more tangible and engaging for the user, all implemented using HTML/CSS/JS/Chart.js Canvas, confirming no SVG or Mermaid JS is used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
